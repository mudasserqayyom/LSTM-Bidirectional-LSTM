Overview:
I this Project i use LSTM and Bidirectional LSTM models for sequential data processing.

Model Architecture:
A short description of the models being used:

LSTM layer with 128 units for capturing sequential dependencies.
Bidirectional LSTM for improved performance by processing data in both forward and backward directions.
Dense layers with ReLU activation and dropout for regularization.
Installation:
I install necessary dependencies, like TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, sk-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

Usage:
Provide sample code on how to use the models, including data preprocessing, model compilation, and training.

Results:
Performance metrics achieved during training and validation (accuracy: 0.9641 - loss: 0.0965 - val_accuracy: 0.1601 - val_loss: 12.7326).

Future Work:
In future i use hyperparameter tuning & GRU for possible improvements.
